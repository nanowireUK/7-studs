TO DO:

DONE * Move Pots up above Hand
DONE * Handle raise (easiest as doesn't trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle call/see (match current pot, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle check (as first player to bet, or to 'call' a previous player's check, could trigger end of round)
* Handle evaluation of hand > 5 cards
  * Just hard-code the 6 or 21 combinations of 5 or 6 from 7 and work though them
  * i.e. no need for clever combination generators
  * note the best hand in each case
* Handle fold (could trigger end of round)
* Handle end game (end of seventh round) (sort out winners, ties, split pots etc.)
* Handle covering the pot
* Plurals ... e.g. Sixs
* Show a representation of the full set of cards, not just the best hand of 5

* Check performance of HashTable: consider making GetHashCode cleverer
* Cross check his 5-card rankings with mine
* Allow for 6 and 7 card hands (need to find PokerHand with best ranking)
* Split hand description out into two parts: main bit e.g. "Ace High" and countback e.g. "with King ..."
* Game name to be pulled from URL
* Find out how to send a message to any one game participant, who may not be the caller

Validation (on client and/or server)
* Prevent player from changing name after joining
* Allow player to rejoin

Find and return next player? Or analyse whole state and determine next action based on e.g. pot contributions?

Check is a pain ... need a whole round of people betting nothing
- keep track of player who last raised or checked, to prevent round continuing endlessly

Covered pots are a pain: player is still in but may not be up to current level of betting
