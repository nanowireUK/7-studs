TO DO:

DONE * Move Pots up above Hand
DONE * Handle raise (easiest as doesn't trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle call/see (match current pot, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle check (as first player to bet, or to 'call' a previous player's check, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle fold (could trigger end of round or end of game)
DONE * Handle evaluation of hand of 6 or 7 cards (work out which is the best 5 card hand of all 6 or 21 combinations)
DONE * Show a one-line representation of the full set of cards, not just the best hand of 5
DONE * Fix plurals, esp. "Sixs"
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> simple case with one winner
DONE * Handle fold triggering end of hand
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> multiple winners (shared pot)
DONE * Show final hand in summary
* Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> split pots
* Handle end of game (time limit, number of rounds, less than 'n' players left in)
* Handle covering the pot
* Handle no one being able to bet (auto-check?)

* Check performance of HashTable: consider making GetHashCode cleverer
* Cross check his 5-card rankings with mine
* Allow for 6 and 7 card hands (need to find PokerHand with best ranking)
* Split hand description out into two parts: main bit e.g. "Ace High" and countback e.g. "with King ..."
* Game name to be pulled from URL
* Find out how to send a message to any one game participant, who may not be the caller

Validation (on client and/or server)
* Prevent player from changing name after joining
* Allow player to rejoin

Find and return next player? Or analyse whole state and determine next action based on e.g. pot contributions?

Check is a pain ... need a whole round of people betting nothing
- keep track of player who last raised or checked, to prevent round continuing endlessly

Covered pots are a pain: player is still in but may not be up to current level of betting
