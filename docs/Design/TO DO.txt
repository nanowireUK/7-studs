----------------------------------------- TO DO (higher priority first) ---------------------------------
* Look into Flux for .NET  (state management framework?) (also Redux which is JS implementation for React)
* Handle no one being able to bet (i.e. auto-check, or other auto-enabled actions)
* Handle end of overall game (time limit, number of rounds, less than 'n' players left in)
* Split hand description out into two parts: main bit e.g. "Ace High" and countback e.g. "with King ..."
* Game name to be pulled from URL
* Record game logs in a database
* Automatically clear a game if there is no activity for n hours
* Allow a player to play blind (?)
----------------------------------------- DONE (most recent first) ---------------------------------------
DONE * Allow actions to determine their own ActionResponseType + ActionResponseAudience, and respect that in the Hub when sending repsonse to player(s)
DONE * Fix replay code following other changes. Simulate connection id during replay, then simulate rejoin when reconstructed players continue playing
DONE * Get rid of ProcessActionAndReturnUpdatedGameStateAsJson
DONE * Prevent player from changing name after joining 
DONE * Allow player to rejoin (or join multiple times) using a rejoin code
DONE * Send each player an updated state that reflects their view of the game
DONE * Remove references to connection id and instead generate a group id and a rejoin code
DONE * Game state to include max raise by current player based on catchup amount and funds available (so client doesn't have to work this out)
DONE * Implement ActionReplay action that re-runs a game using the JSON-serialised GameLog as a script
DONE * Create GameLog and GameLogAction objects on the Game and populate them as the game progresses
DONE * Add ActionAvailabilityList to JSON, showing which actions are available to which players at any time
DONE * Prevent players joining during the game
DONE * Prevent blank or duplicate players joining
DONE * Handle covering the pot (is this only when the player cannot match the current bet?)
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> allow for multiple pots
DONE * Show final hand in summary
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> multiple winners (shared pot)
DONE * Add a new field Commentary as list of strings (to replace LastEvent eventually)
DONE * Handle fold triggering end of hand
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> simple case with one winner
DONE * Fix plurals, esp. "Sixs"
DONE * Show a one-line representation of the full set of cards, not just the best hand of 5
DONE * Handle evaluation of hand of 6 or 7 cards (work out which is the best 5 card hand of all 6 or 21 combinations)
DONE * Handle fold (could trigger end of round or end of game)
DONE * Handle check (as first player to bet, or to 'call' a previous player's check, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle call/see (match current pot, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle raise (easiest as doesn't trigger end of round)
DONE * Move Pots up above Hand
