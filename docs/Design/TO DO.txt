----------------------------------------- SERVER-SIDE TO DO (higher priority first) ---------------------------------
* Protect ad hoc query further ... can we use config to provide a secret prefix for the request number? I.e. nothing visible in GitHub
* Is a simple spectator mode possible?
    - Join as anonymous Spectator (just adds the connection to a list of spectators for the game)
    - Spectator mode would have to hide all players' down cards. Start with player 0.
    - Once registered, any Spectator would receive all updates  
* Extend lobby data to include game event summary ... timings, # of hands played, joiners, order in which people went to zero chips, chips for those left in
* Database to preserve/restore game status
* Why does setting the admin sometimes not work (as part of leave game)?
* Add game time, hands played, etc.
* Think about whether any hands should be automatically revealed, e.g. in hand order
* Tidy up hand commentary (remove references to cards)
* Handle Admin activities (remove player, ...). What if admin is themselves disconnected/indisposed?
* Add some parameters to game lobby (ante, stash, checkboxes for rule options e.g. randomise on restart)
* Show hands in a clear way (e.g. full house as 333AA not A33A3)
* Look into Flux for .NET  (state management framework?) (also Redux which is JS implementation for React)
* Handle no one being able to bet (i.e. auto-check, or other auto-enabled actions)
* Handle end of overall game (time limit, number of rounds, less than 'n' players left in)
* Split hand description out into two parts: main bit e.g. "Ace High" and countback e.g. "with King ..."
* Game name to be pulled from URL
* Allow a player to play blind (?)
----------------------------------------- CLIENT-SIDE THOUGHTS ---------------------------------
* Make it possible to toggle to a vertical view (with players stacked on top to enable a skinny side-panel view)
----------------------------------------- DONE (most recent first) ---------------------------------------
DONE * Fix double commentary
DONE * Automatically reset a game that has been inactive for more than 120 mins
DONE * Made AdHocQuery slight less open in that callers have to know the 'commands' it supports (not just a number from 1 to n)
DONE * For non-existent games, only allow Join. All other commands are controlled by game and player state.
DONE * Block access to test features when running on the public web server
DONE * Add an AdHocQuery action as framework for quick test features
DONE * Don't allow more than 8 people into a game 
DONE * Fixed (I hope) a bug in MaxRaise (when a less well-funded opponent has already gone all in)
DONE * 'Join' and 'Open' action both now call 'ReceiveLobbyData' on client (not 'ReceiveMyGameState')
DONE * Record bankruptcy events throughout all hands of a game
DONE * Added 'GetMyState' action (to help on server web page only)
DONE * Added 'ReceiveLobbyData' to client (chat.js only)
DONE * Added 'Continue' action (to resume current game with new hand)
DONE * Implemented 'CommunityCard' (for when not enough cards to full deal last round of cards)
DONE * Create lobby data for when player joins or admin reopens lobby
DONE * If only one player left in at end of hand, don't reveal their hand in the game results
DONE * If not enough cards to fully deal round 7, deal a community card (everyone gets the same last card)
DONE * Don't allow someone to reveal if they have already revealed (allowing for reveal in both modes)
DONE * Remove card details from the HandCommentary
DONE * Handle the section at the end of a hand where players reveal their hands (or folder) in turn
DONE * Fix double display in some StatusMessages
DONE * Add a new StatusMessage field which summarises LastEvent and NextAction
DONE * Make each player's player-centric view show them as the first player 
DONE * Remove all references to indexes in the player-centric views
DONE * Add 'Open' command that enables administrator to reopen the lobby at the end of a hand
DONE * Allow players to choose to reveal their cards at the end of a hand
DONE * Add game modes (LobbyOpen, HandInProgress, HandCompleted) and calculate permission in one place at the end of an action
DONE * Calculate permissions for each player from their perspective (and just show command that are available to them)
DONE * Separate out the server-side methods for each action (e.g. UserClickedJoin, UserClickStart, etc.)
DONE * Allow actions to determine their own ActionResponseType + ActionResponseAudience, and respect that in the Hub when sending repsonse to player(s)
DONE * Fix replay code following other changes. Simulate connection id during replay, then simulate rejoin when reconstructed players continue playing
DONE * Get rid of ProcessActionAndReturnUpdatedGameStateAsJson
DONE * Prevent player from changing name after joining 
DONE * Allow player to rejoin (or join multiple times) using a rejoin code
DONE * Send each player an updated state that reflects their view of the game
DONE * Remove references to connection id and instead generate a group id and a rejoin code
DONE * Game state to include max raise by current player based on catchup amount and funds available (so client doesn't have to work this out)
DONE * Implement ActionReplay action that re-runs a game using the JSON-serialised GameLog as a script
DONE * Create GameLog and GameLogAction objects on the Game and populate them as the game progresses
DONE * Add ActionAvailabilityList to JSON, showing which actions are available to which players at any time
DONE * Prevent players joining during the game
DONE * Prevent blank or duplicate players joining
DONE * Handle covering the pot (is this only when the player cannot match the current bet?)
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> allow for multiple pots
DONE * Show final hand in summary
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> multiple winners (shared pot)
DONE * Add a new field Commentary as list of strings (to replace LastEvent eventually)
DONE * Handle fold triggering end of hand
DONE * Handle end of hand (i.e. end of seventh round) -> simple case with one winner
DONE * Fix plurals, esp. "Sixs"
DONE * Show a one-line representation of the full set of cards, not just the best hand of 5
DONE * Handle evaluation of hand of 6 or 7 cards (work out which is the best 5 card hand of all 6 or 21 combinations)
DONE * Handle fold (could trigger end of round or end of game)
DONE * Handle check (as first player to bet, or to 'call' a previous player's check, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle call/see (match current pot, could trigger end of round)
DONE * Handle raise (easiest as doesn't trigger end of round)
DONE * Move Pots up above Hand
