To convert old-style game logs (where Deck objects inherit from Stack instead of being composed of them):

- (1) Use Notepad++ JSON plugin to format original JSON to check ok

- (2) Use Notepad++ JSON plugin to compress the JSON (Ctrl-Alt-Shift-C)
      - Having it all as one long string avoids the need for complicated regular expressions that include newlines

- (3) Do the global edits below, which will allow old and new format deck structure:
      - old format: list of list of cards
      - new format: list of Deck objects that each include a list of cards

	- (a) Global replace (for change in attribute name):

		- "playersInOrder"
		- "playersInOrderAtStartOfGame"	

	- (b) Global replace (for the initial deck) ... should be one change only:

		- "decks":[[{"CardValue"
		- "decks":[{"Cards":[{"CardValue"
		
	- (c) Global replace (for the gaps between decks) ... one change per deck:

		- }],[{
		- }]},{"Cards":[{

	- (d) Global replace (to close the decks out) ... should be one change only:

		- }]]}
		- }]}]}

- (4) Use Notepad++ JSON plugin to reformat the JSON (Ctrl-Alt-Shift-M)

- (5) Ensure correct 'administrator' is defined	at the top (this is the person who started the game)

- (6) Remove any JOIN actions that appear before the START action (as these joins will be done automatically by the REPLAY)

- (7) Use the Replay action (from the server screen)
		- Join any random game with any player name
		- Paste the entire game log (that you have just reconstructed above) into the Parameters field
		- Click ReplayGameFromLog
		- If all runs ok it will return the 'overall game state'
		- In the Participants area, find a player name and their RejoinCode
		- Enter these into the User and Parameters area respectively and click Rejoin This Game
		- Click Get Game Log
		- That is the cleansed game log, with correct action numbers, deck ids, etc. 
		- Compare it with the reconstructed game log just to be sure (all differences should be obvious and explainable)
		- Add comments/notes as required
		- Save the cleansed game log in the Game Logs area
