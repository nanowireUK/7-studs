To replay a game from Visual Studio Code using a saved GameLog from e.g. .\docs\Testing\Game Logs

1) Start the client:
   - From the Menu, click Terminal > New Terminal
   - Enter 'cd client'
   - Enter 'npm start'
   - If it says 'Something is already running on port 3000', hit enter to start on a different port
   - At this point a web page will open saying 'Cannot connect to server'
   - Leave this page open
2) Hit F5 (or select Run > Start Debugging from the menu) to start the server and bring up the server page (index.cshtml) in another browser window
3) Prepare your GameLog in an external editor such as Notepad++ (e.g. copy from one of the saved game logs)
   - If desired, add a line "PauseAfter": 50 to cause the replay to pause after the action with an "ActionNumber" of 50
4) Copy and paste the prepared game log into the Parameters field of the server screen (note that Room and User are not required)
5) Click 'Replay Game From Log'
6) Check the Debug Console for results, but if all runs ok the server web page will return a Room name and list the rejoin codes for all players
7) Copy and paste the rejoinCodes section into e.g. Notepad++ for use in later steps
8) In the client web page (from step 1):
    - Click Refresh (this should now show the Seven Studs login page)
    - Enter the Room name that was used for the replay
    - Enter a player name and rejoin code from the list of rejoin codes and click Join
    - This will bring you to the game state as it was at the end of the log (or as it was following the action that you paused at)
9) Also join this game from the server window (as any one of the players)
10) Use the Step and Advance functions to move the game on one step or multiple steps at a time
11) Alternatively, if any of the players makes an actual game move, this will stop the replay and allow play to continue normally from that point onwards

    ///////////////// Need to understand this: if you open a second window it will show the same as the first one. How do you get it to allow you to login again --> LEAVE
		- Enter these into the User and Parameters area respectively and click Rejoin This Game
		- Click Get Game Log
		- That is the cleansed game log, with correct action numbers, deck ids, etc. 
		- Compare it with the reconstructed game log just to be sure (all differences should be obvious and explainable)
		- Add comments/notes as required
		- Save the cleansed game log in the Game Logs area

        Server/- (6) Use the Replay action (from the server screen)

When testing all the different database scenarios
-------------------------------------------------

Tests in most practical order:

- No Cosmos DB emulation available
	- NoDatabase (quickest test)
	- Recoverability
	- Stateless
- Cosmos DB emulation started
	- Stateless
	- Recoverability
